This is a Project to implement a communication application in WLAN.
#branch describe
There are two branches which include [master](server) and [client].

#server
It includes database that hold users' infomation and the transction handle
program.The most intersting things of server is that it has not need a 
fixed ip address like most server doing in the Internet.You can downdload
the server-program-package and data to every host that has a wlan ip address.
Then every client in this wlan will find the server automatic.

#client
It provide the most of servers that other communication application can do.
But it is good at for file transmit,specia for big-file.
